# Personal Bank API Integration

This project is a website that leverages the API functions of my personal bank. The API is provided by [Up](https://developer.up.com.au/#getting-started).

The idea stems from the fact, that the information was only avaliable via an app on my phone.

As well as testing out vite/ react as frameworks.

## Overview

The website allows users to interact with their bank account through the following features:

- View account details
- Retrieve transaction history
